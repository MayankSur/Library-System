Book Library Management
=========

Uses the SQLAlchemy Database to create a store for books
Each book contains a name, price and ISBN

Reason for building
---------------

The aim was to get an experience in web development from a front-end perspective. This project was created with no prior knowledge of HTTP, Flask, SQLAlchemy. Minimal experience with docker was converted into a beginner standard.

The Flask Server is connected on port 5000 and was tested for correct functionality via [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com/).

Getting started
---------------
1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
2. `you need to give access permission to run.sh file (chmod +x run.sh in terminal)`
3. Open http://localhost:5000 - Docker containers shall be created via the script and connection done via port-forwarding.
4. 'POST, PUT, PATCH & GET requests all currently functioning'
